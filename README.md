## Project 1-Customer churn prediction
## Objective
Objective is to predict customer churn in a U.S bank using machine learning algorithm.
## Steps involved
### Data collection and preprocessing:
Checked number of rows and columns.missing values.
### Exploratory Data Analysis:
Visualise the distribution of Age,Credit score,salaray.checked how many customer are churned in the dataset.
### Feature selection and Feature engineering:
Only important variables(columns) are taken for churn prediction,converted non numeric columns to numeric columns
### Model building:
Tested model-Logistic regression
### Model evalution:
Confusion matrix-checked accuracy
### outcome
The outcome of this customer churn prediction project involves developing a machine learning model to predict whether customers are likely to churn or not. This prediction is based on various customer attributes such as age, gender,CreditScore,geography,tenure,balance,has card,estimated salary. The model's primary purpose is to assist in identifying customers who are at a higher risk of churning, enabling the business to take proactive measures to retain them. By using the trained model to predict churn, the company can allocate resources more effectively, personalize engagement strategies, and implement targeted retention efforts. Ultimately, the project's success is measured by the model's ability to make predictions, helping the company reduce churn rates, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize its customer retention strategies
